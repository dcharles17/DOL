# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is currently an empty repository with no existing code or configuration files. When initializing a new project here, Claude should:

1. Ask the user about the intended project type and technology stack
2. Create appropriate configuration files based on the project requirements
3. Set up the basic project structure following best practices for the chosen technology

## Development Setup

Since no project has been initialized yet, there are no specific commands or architecture to document. This file should be updated once the project is set up with:

- Build and development commands
- Testing framework and commands
- Code architecture and structure
- Any project-specific conventions or patterns
